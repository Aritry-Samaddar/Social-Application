# Social-Application
This is a social media application where you can post anything(any writing or text) of your choice and also you can react to other people's
post. It needs you to sign in to the application with your email id.

In today's world of Facebook and Instagram, people don't write posts anymore, they rather scroll through feeds. But I believe communications through writings can do magic. When you read something you get a chance to look into something with different perspective. Every reader creates sub writings out of the writing. Sometimes it helps you to learn something new which you didn't know before. That's why I made this application, to make people updated through posts which you have to read and also to help people write and get things out to the world, to make a comfortable space for people who wants to make use of it positively. This application will help you taste the power of unity.
